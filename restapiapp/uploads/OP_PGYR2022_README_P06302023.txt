1. Program Year 2022 Data Files 

This data set includes records submitted for Program Year 2022 that have been matched with total confidence to a particular covered recipient (i.e., physician, non-physician practitioner or teaching hospital) and displays information about that recipient. This data set includes the most recent attested-to data for Program Year 2022 as of May 30, 2023.

The data set contained in the comma-separated value (CSV) file includes only the data that is eligible for publication. Consult the Open Payments Methodology and Data Dictionary Document for an explanation of the criteria that the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) used to determine what data to publish. This document can be found on the Resources page of the Open Payments website (https://www.cms.gov/OpenPayments/Resources). The Methodology and Data Dictionary Document also includes information on the data collection and reporting methodology, data fields included in the files, and any notes or special considerations that users should be aware of.

Each record in the General Payment, Research Payment, and Ownership/Investment files includes a Change Type indicator field.  The Change Type Value indicator fields are: NEW
* NEW – indicates that the record is newly reported by the reporting entity since the last publication and is being published for the first time. 

Since Program Year 2022 is the latest Program Year, there is no removed and Deleted Records file.

2. Considerations for using the CSV Files 

Microsoft Excel removes leading zeroes from data fields in CSV files. Certain fields in these data sets may have leading zeroes. These zeroes will be missing when viewing the information within Microsoft Excel. 

Additionally, the latest versions of Microsoft Excel cannot display data sets with more than 1,048,576 rows. Some of these CSV files may exceed that limit. Displaying the data in its entirety may require the use of spreadsheet programs capable of handling very large numbers of records.

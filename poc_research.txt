Based on our discussions, your **Proof of Concept (POC)** requires an architecture that supports:

1. **High Concurrency**  
2. **Asynchronous Processing**  
3. **Resilience and Fault Tolerance**  
4. **Scalability**  
5. **Simplicity for Management and Monitoring**

Given these needs, I recommend an architecture that combines the following concepts and tools:

---

## **Recommended Architecture Overview**

This architecture uses **event-driven communication** for decoupling services, **workflow orchestration** for reliability, and **scalable components** for high concurrency.

---

### **Key Components**

1. **Event-Driven Communication**:  
   - Use **Apache Kafka** as the event broker for decoupling services and enabling high-throughput messaging.

2. **Microservices**:  
   - Each task (file upload, text extraction, embeddings generation, summarization) is its own independent microservice.
   - Each microservice exposes a **REST API** for direct invocation and integrates with Kafka for asynchronous processing.

3. **Orchestration with Temporal.io**:  
   - Use **Temporal.io** to orchestrate workflows and manage retries, task dependencies, and state persistence.
   - Temporal ensures resilience in the workflow execution and handles long-running tasks.

4. **Scalable Infrastructure**:  
   - Deploy the system using **Kubernetes** for container orchestration.
   - Services are horizontally scalable to handle high concurrency.

5. **Storage**:  
   - Use **AWS S3** or an equivalent for storing raw documents.
   - Use a **vector database** like **OpenSearch** or **Pinecone** for document embeddings.

6. **Monitoring and Logging**:  
   - Use **Prometheus + Grafana** for metrics monitoring.
   - Use **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for centralized logging.

### **Resilient and Sustainable Architecture Diagram**

Hereâ€™s a high-level breakdown of the architecture:

1. **File Upload Service**:
   - REST API â†’ Upload file to S3 â†’ Publish `file_uploaded` event to Kafka.

2. **Extract Text Service**:
   - Kafka Consumer â†’ Consume `file_uploaded` â†’ Process task â†’ Publish `text_extracted` to Kafka.

3. **Generate Embeddings Service**:
   - Kafka Consumer â†’ Consume `text_extracted` â†’ Generate embeddings â†’ Publish `embeddings_generated` to Kafka.

4. **Summarize Text Service**:
   - Kafka Consumer â†’ Consume `embeddings_generated` â†’ Summarize text â†’ Publish `summary_generated`.

5. **Temporal Orchestrator Service**:
   - Starts the workflow when the file upload begins.
   - Calls REST endpoints (optional) and listens for Kafka events to coordinate the workflow steps.

6. **Vector Database**:
   - Stores document embeddings for further querying.

7. **Monitoring**:
   - Logs and metrics collected for Kafka, Temporal, and microservices.

---

### **Architecture Flow**

1. **Step 1: File Upload**  
   - The **File Upload Service** exposes a REST endpoint.  
   - The service uploads the file to **S3** and publishes a `file_uploaded` event to **Kafka**.

2. **Step 2: Extract Text**  
   - The **Extract Text Service** listens to the `file_uploaded` Kafka topic.  
   - It extracts text from the document and publishes a `text_extracted` event.

3. **Step 3: Generate Embeddings**  
   - The **Generate Embeddings Service** listens to the `text_extracted` event.  
   - It generates embeddings using a model (e.g., Hugging Face or AWS Bedrock) and publishes a `embeddings_generated` event.

4. **Step 4: Summarize Text**  
   - The **Summarize Text Service** listens to the `embeddings_generated` event.  
   - It summarizes the text and publishes a `summary_generated` event.

5. **Step 5: Temporal Workflow**  
   - The **Temporal Orchestrator Service** starts and monitors the workflow.  
   - Temporal integrates with Kafka or directly calls REST endpoints at each stage.  
   - It handles retries, task failures, and guarantees stateful execution.

6. **Step 6: Final Output**  
   - The orchestrator service consolidates the results and optionally sends them via AWS SNS or stores them in a vector database for querying.

---

## **Sustainability and Resilience Features**

1. **High Concurrency**:
   - Kafka partitions ensure that messages are processed in parallel by multiple consumers.
   - Microservices scale horizontally (using Kubernetes) to handle spikes in load.

2. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Kafka ensures that no messages are lost during service failures (messages are retained).
   - Temporal retries failed workflows and tasks with exponential backoff.

3. **Decoupling**:
   - Kafka decouples each microservice, allowing them to fail or scale independently.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Stateless microservices scale horizontally.
   - Kafka brokers and Temporal workers can be distributed across nodes for high throughput.

5. **Workflow Management**:
   - Temporal orchestrates workflows with full visibility into task states.
   - Long-running tasks can be paused, retried, or restarted without manual intervention.

6. **Observability**:
   - Metrics (Prometheus/Grafana) and centralized logging (ELK) ensure system-wide visibility.
